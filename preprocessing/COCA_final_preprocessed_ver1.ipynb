            "I have come close to implying that the Ninth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a kind of father figure to me .\n",
            "At that time , all these sentiments were also true of my unquestioned attitudes toward my father .\n",
            "Writing my own article for the EB was a psychological landmark ; it gave me a voice of my own .\n",
            "I suddenly felt like Ernest Pontifex , in The Way of All Flesh , who was finally able to contravene his father without feeling that he was either destroying or betraying him .\n",
            "Before I wrote my  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  article , I looked at two or three earlier pieces .\n",
            "It did not occur to me then to view them as documents of intellectual history ; I merely wished to identify my predecessors ' pitfalls - such as an overreliance on dreary tables of statistics - so I could avoid stepping into them myself .\n",
            "I wrote the article and proudly added the Fourteenth Edition of the Britannica to the Ninth Edition that still reposed in the glass-fronted Stickley bookcase that I had inherited .\n",
            "Two and a half decades passed .\n",
            "Then , as I approached the age of eighty , I had another thought .\n",
            "Why not examine the articles on suicide in all the editions since the first one , in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  ?\n",
            "The idea allowed me simultaneously to become , all over again , the unformed child in a soft bed who had learned about the world from his parents ' encyclopedia , and also to read these articles on suicide - including my own - and see , from the emancipated vantage point of old age , their flaws , their anachronisms , their generational gaps of knowledge .\n",
            "If the Britannica was the most authoritative popular repository of knowledge during the various eras of its existence , would not its successive treatments of suicide reflect , in a long chronological march , our culture 's changing attitudes toward the subject that had consumed my life ?\n",
            "Is it a crime ?\n",
            "Is it the responsibility of the individual or of society ?\n",
            "What causes it ?\n",
            "Can human suffering be reduced to statistics ?\n",
            "How can suicide be prevented ?\n",

            "Buckle 's morally neutral stance , which transfers blame from the individual to his society , neatly moves suicide from the purview of religion to that of social science and presages the key role that demography was soon to play in its study .\n",

            "In his essay \" On Liberty \" - in which he opposed any legislation that would interfere with the sale of poisons on the ground that it would exert unnecessary state control over individual freedom-he wrote  , he ought , I conceive , be only warned of the danger , not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it .\n",

            "Winding up his story , Burnet bids an affectionate goodbye , as to a familiar figure : \" There we leave Earth ; Having conducted it for the space of Seven Thousand Years , through various changes from a dark Chaos to a bright Star .\n",
            "From the next century 's perspective , Erasmus Darwin 's syncretic conceits in The Botanic Garden  - his millennial vision , for example , of \" Nymphs \" towing icebergs to the equator to equalize the climates , thereby allowing Earth to return to its Edenic state - would seem even quainter .\n",
            "For eighteenth-century Westerners , alchemy and the sympathetic identifications had been increasingly exiled to the realm of ornamental metaphor and - for wits like Pope - outright satire .\n",
            "Though Neoplatonic metaphors continued to exert a strong influence on the new empiricists and vestiges of the old Naturphilosophie would be revived by Goethe , Humboldt , and others well into the nineteenth century , after the Renaissance \" the means of internalizing the cosmos , \" as Ernest Tuveson has said , would be \" by the aesthetic \" rather than natural science .\n",
            "We must look to literary , not scientific , descendants of Fluddian natural philosophy for the continuing identification of self with globe and cosmos .\n",
            "From Dante to John Bunyan , the quest literature of Christianity had always boasted authors who , much like the classical and medieval mnemonists , created their own special kind of inner topography .\n",
            "In the concrete allegory of these narratives , outer and inner worlds describe each other ; the spiritual journey enacts itself in the physical journey , and vice versa .\n",
            "Unlike the discourse of natural philosophy , however , the underlying terms of this literary genre were not immediately - and in some eases , never - erased by the rapidly changing philosophical , religious , and scientific worldview of the Enlightenment and later .\n",
            "From the Romantic era on , this Neoplatonic tradition would be carried on in a distinct group of literary sea and adventure narratives that , while ostensibly imitating the real feats of Western explorers circumnavigating the globe , became the vehicle for a new kind of soul quest through the geocosm .\n",
            "Now as earlier , this spiritualizing of physical geography would require that the journey be undertaken by real people and start at a quantifiable point in time and space in the physical world precisely in order to end up in an internalized soul region outside time and space .\n",
            "Using the topographical allegorizing of the religious narratives , they would also oblige their readers to employ , within their own interpretative process , the analogic principles of the old discarded science .\n",
            "For the Romantics and their literary heirs , the artist became Robert Fludd 's Pan who fashions a world that is the perfect mirror of his own insides .\n",
            "Coleridge and Poe would imagine their journeys in a Hermetic mode , creating visionary landscapes in which elements are first hypothesized , then appear ; possibilities are entertained , then materialize .\n",
            "Nowhere is this complicated Renaissance heritage more strikingly apparent than in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western fictional narratives of journeys to the Poles , and particularly  to the South Pole .\n",
            "The historical path of this identification follows the same development as that for the Earth generally .\n",
            "Pole began as an astronomical term  , first as the entire axis of the celestial sphere , then as the two fixed points in the celestial sphere around which the stars seemed to revolve .\n",
            "By the sixteenth century , pole signified the two points at which the earth 's axis met the celestial sphere .\n",
            "The term pole was also extended to each of the two opposite points on the surface of a magnet , which aligns itself north-south .\n",
            "The magnetic poles of the earth are these two points in the North and South Poles , respectively , where the compass needle takes a vertical position .\n",
            "The magnet , of course , was a crucial tool for mariners in finding their way  .\n",
            "Thus the Poles , in both their \" true \" and \" magnetic \" manifestations , are orienting points .\n",
            "In microcosmic terms , this means they are the orienting loci of the psyche , but by the same token they are also the least known , the farthest from consciousness , the points  where the transcendent and celestial spheres have special access to the human sphere .\n",
            "Lucretius and other ancient commentators , however , derided the idea of an inhabited southern area because their position on the sphere  would oblige these people to hang upside down by their feet .\n",
            "Nonetheless , the belief in a large southern land region led Ptolemy in the second century C.E. to posit the \" Terra Australis Incognita , \" a southern continent completely enclosing the Indian Ocean - an hypothesis that would be accepted as geographical fad for the next fifteen hundred years .\n",
            "Even as late as the eighteenth century , Shaftesbury could comment , about his map of nature : \" In the places most remote from man 's works and occupations we encounter the manifestation of the divine Mind pure and undefiled .\n",
            "\" Out of this tradition comes the implicit identification of the Poles with the furthest unknown reaches of the self/world and , for that very reason , with its transcendent center as well .\n",
            "For what is farthest away and most hidden is , paradoxically , always what is most important : the journey to the pole is a journey to the center of the soul .\n",
            "A mystic or occult notion of both Poles also figures strongly in alchemists ' speculations about the resonating inner and outer worlds .\n",
            "He who journeys through this great and wide sea may touch at both Indies , may guide his course by the sight of the North Star , which our Magnet will cause to appear to you .\n",

            "Universally recognized as \" the travelogue of a spiritual journey , \" the Ancient Mariner is a profoundly alchemical and elemental poem that most closely resembles the medieval dream vision whose landscape provides fixed points for meditation and self-reflection .\n",
            "In Burnetian  terms , if humans lost their inner vision at the Fall , a journey to the Pole must involve an initial failure to recognize that the journey has an esoteric as well as an exoteric meaning ; this failure must produce catastrophe followed by suffering and eventual redemption .\n",
            "And this is exactly what happens in the Ancient Mariner : a man blind to his inner spirit  kills it , but is redeemed when he experiences love for God 's creatures  as his ship or body journeys on the larger Body of the globe , pushed by angelic forces in a harrowing voyage of self-discovery .\n",
            "Ultimately , the \" lonesome Spirit from the south pole \" guides the mariner 's boat back to civilization , where it sinks in a maelstrom , leaving him the sole survivor .\n",

            "We take it as a good psychotopographic sign that the sinking occurs dose to the Ekemene , home base in Europe , because that suggests the experience inflicted on the mariner is more accessible to his  consciousness than any action taking place at the Pole itself .\n",
            "In the two voices of the Ancient Mariner - one a pre-Shakespearean sixteenth-century balladeer and the other his Percylike antiquarian commentator , from roughly Burnet 's time - Coleridge 's obvious strategy , as Jerome McGann and others have shown , is to reproduce not just the flavor of an archaic ballad , but a sense , as in the Old and New Testaments , of multiple textual layers .\n",
            "In fact , the poem amounts to a kind of self-contained Burnetian geological process of its own , a little evolving world of complex textual strata .\n",

            "Poe , like Coleridge , drew heavily on explorers ' accounts , but even more heavily on the old notions of the animate universe : in the warm waters he bestows on the Antarctic Ocean we see the classical legends of the warm waters of Hyperborea , the land behind the North Wind .\n",
            "More specifically , he uses the then-popular theories of John Cleves Symmes , an army captain turned natural philosopher who postulated a hollow earth composed of five concentric spheres  accessible through holes near the North and South Poles .\n",
            "Considered the first piece of American utopian fiction , Symzonia describes Captain Seaborn 's most American determination to discover a \" new and untried world \" because \" the resources of the known world have been exhausted by research , its wealth monopolized , its wonders of curiosity explored , its every thing investigated and understood !\n",

            "In Poe 's only novel , action must be imaginatively anticipated before it can be made manifest , events seem only to proceed while the first-person narrator lies in a swoon , and Pym awakens each time to find himself regressed into ever more outrageously claustrophobic and life-threatening predicaments .\n",
            "This repetitive retreat into lowered or obliterated consciousness is a microcosmic journey to his own self 's Terra Incognita , an ongoing dress rehearsal of the outer journey that will end so obscurely .\n",
            "In the symbolic terms of Poe 's magic cosmos throughout his literary works , falling into a hole or pit is the transforming moment of death , and this recurring private and personal Symmes Hole becomes the inevitable destination in both the smaller and larger predicaments of Pym .\n",
            "It is the reason that Poe can provide no depiction of the South Pole itself , or of Pym 's reaching it .\n",
            "Pym presents its own complicated pastiche of textual fragments recounted by at least three narrators , two of whom are unidentified .\n",

            "In Poe , as in Coleridge before him , these mysterious white figures embody the transcendental and unearthly dimension of the southern polar region .\n",

            "When your child tells you about a school experience , ask for details and express your feelings .\n",
            "For example , in discussing a book read in class , ask how the protagonists must have felt in the situation your child describes .\n",
            "Share your own feelings with your child or memories of similar experiences in your life .\n",

            "Good teachers are worth their weight in gold ; experts are a dime a dozen .\n",
            "Problem solving is a learnable set of steps using logic , rationalism , organizational skills , and decision-making patterns .\n",
            "Help your child think through these processes .\n",
            "While we should n't deliberately withhold information , a measured response can help a child to think critically and develop an answer on his or her own .\n",
            "* Children gain self-esteem by learning and sharing knowledge .\n",
            "Being able to contribute as part of a team rather than as a mere recipient of information builds a child 's sense of self-worth .\n",
            "* Many become excessively dependent on a psychoanalyst , a cleric , a political leader , a parent , or a physician to provide them with their beliefs .\n",
            "Fundamentalism is n't limited the fringes of some religions .\n",
            "The importance of an authority figure to many people is growing , not diminishing as we might hope as time goes on and society matures .\n",
            "We all need to be careful to avoid creating powerful dependency needs in our children .\n",
            "Ask yourself if it 's more important that your children be just like you or that they each be independent , self-reliant individuals , even if it means you might disagree on some issues .\n",
            "The most functional parents guide their children to independence .\n",
            "Be a guide on the side , not a sage on a stage .\n",
            "* As a parent , you can help your children enormously to become self-learners by supporting their skills in making choices .\n",
            "Learning the processes of making choices - weighing the alternatives , remembering earlier experiences , seeing what others have done in similar situations - can be of enormous help to them , especially as they face issues like the temptations of drug use , choice of friends , career goals , and the like .\n",
            "How your children make these choices is a learning to learn issue and one that most of us neglect in our own lives .\n",
            "Careful decision making can mean the difference between success and failure in many of life 's arenas .\n",

            "Touching the small white block at the bottom of the screen makes the larger block white , touching the black one changes it to black , and touching the small white and black block has the effect of changing the pattern of the larger block to black and white .\n",

            "Beginning with Weisskopf-Joelson 's  thesis that theories of psychotherapy may be \" perceptual houses \" with their own unique value structures , we studied the values of psychoanalytic psychotherapists within the framework of Rokeach 's  system .\n",
            "Through the Rokeach Value Survey , we examined the values held by a group of psychoanalytic trainees in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  and those held by a group of practicing psychoanalysts in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  .\n",
            "Because neither group of subjects can be regarded as randomly representative of the universe of psychoanalysts , we regard the resultant data as evocative and informative rather than definitive .\n",
            "Nonetheless , we examined the extent to which value profiles for the psychoanalytic trainees of  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  were similar or dissimilar to those of practicing psychoanalysts in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  .\n",
            "Such comparisons at the least provide some general indication as to whether valu es have shifted in the universe within this time period .\n",
            "Findings are presented about specific patterns of values , and implications are discussed .\n",
            "Values seem to evoke much discussion and controversy .\n",
            "In the public domain , \" family \" values , \" religious \" values , \" good \" values , or \" bad \" values are discussed as if their criteria are self-evident .\n",
            "In addition , values have generated interest in such areas as \" moral \" and \" value \" education and \" values clarification .\n",
            "\" This pervasiveness attests to the importance of the notion as well as to its lack of clarity .\n",
            "People have values .\n",
            "Institutions have values .\n",
            "Societies have values .\n",
            "These seem to be accepted truths , although they remain vague and general .\n",
            "Not surprisingly , the field of psychotherapy has not been immune from the wide ranging , yet imprecise , presence of the elusive construct of values .\n",
            "The values that an individual can express are very much constrained by the character of the social institutions and the social order in which that individual lives  .\n",
            "Rokeach  , in addressing this issue , defined institutional values as \" socially shared cognitive representations of institutional goals and demands \"  and suggested that \" the most distinctive property or defining characteristic of a social institution is its values \"  .\n",
            "Scientific psychology has consistently kept the question of values out of its system , in its attempt to stress the scientifically objective component of its field  .\n",
            "In this context , it is interesting to find that some authors see psychotherapy as sharing the interactional arena with the arts , in that they both feature the constant interchange between values and technique  even though it was understood that people could not maintain this ideal objective stance .\n",
            "It would appear that , although values were recognized as inevitable , the ideal remained of a possible value-free endeavor , and deviation there-from were seen as problems of the therapist or labeled as \" countertransference .\n",
            "\" Indeed , values have often been noted in psychotherapy in a negative context - i.e. , as a problem when therapy is not proceeding according to the \" script .\n",
            "In a circumscribed context , however , values were reckoned with in a positive perspective .\n",
            "Hartman  conceptualized one prevalent view by positing that the only values that are relevant in psychotherapy are so called \" health values , \" or those very directly related to the work at hand .\n",
            "These \" health values \" have generated definitions ranging from Freud 's  truth and reality , to the sufficient conditions for the nurturing of the ego  , the facilitating environment of Object Relations theory  , the definition of the self  , awareness and integration in a Gestalt perspective  , and Rogers '  basic therapeutic conditions , to present a representative sample .\n",
            "Instead , they are often featured in fields which represent the intersections of psychotherapy and allied disciplines .\n",
            "The contemporary psychosomatic approach incorporates values into its presuppositions  .\n",
            "The hermeneutic method of analyzing psychotherapy , for example , refers to \" guiding values \" of the conversation which effects change  .\n",
            "The adherents of Logotherapy blatantly present their approach as a system of values similar to those of a secular religion  .\n",
            "Related to the latter characterization , is the assumption in existential psychology that one 's attitude toward authenticity is influenced by the therapist 's personal values  .\n",
            "Moreover , values are intrinsic to some of the more recent areas where psychology and social issues have been synthesized .\n",
            "Constructivism , for example , sees values as playing a central role in clinical practice  .\n",
            "Other authors actually typify feminist-oriented psychotherapy by positing a distinct value profile for the approach  .\n",
            "Postmodern authors on psychotherapy uniformly highlight the salience of the practitioner 's values  .\n",
            "An index of values ' emerging prominence in the field is the recent straightforward call by the Society for the Exploration of Psychotherapy Integration , calling for the definition of psychotherapy integration while highlighting values as a cardinal factor in therapy  .\n",
            "It is noteworthy that the directionality of influence between psychotherapy and values also runs in the reverse .\n",
            "Thus , criteria have been offered for therapists to determine whether their clients ' religiosity is particularly healthy or unhealthy  , which seems to portend an attempt at objectively qualifying the legitimacy  of values in the counseling interaction .\n",
            "In categorizing values by the phenomena which precipitate and give rise to the values , some authors have been led to actually categorize values as rational vs.\n",
            "Specifically , individual values will often entail goals which encroach on others ' needs , while societal values often usurp individual needs for the good of the larger group .\n",
            "The therapies can be seen as attempting to balance intrinsic values against the backdrop of a field-wide mor of commitment to human freedom without dogmatism , in a mode which will respect human autonomy .\n",
            "In a detailed analysis of therapy approaches , Richardson  shows how Freud , Jung , Fromm , and Rational Emotive approaches all employ similar strategies in dealing with this freedom-commitment dilemma , although each stresses different aspects as primary .\n",
            "Weiskopf-Joelson refers to each school of psychotherapy as a \" perceptual house \" since each perspective brings with it a distinct set of preconceptions and apperceptions which structure reality according to its a priori postulates and beliefs .\n",
            "These \" houses \" include value systems which , though rarely explicit , are nonetheless normative in that setting and are seen as desirable goals of any therapeutic intervention .\n",
            "If they are \" perceptual houses , \" then they are not merely a collection of individuals but have more the qualities and characteristics of an institution .\n",
            "It follows , then , that as a prototype of an institution , each therapeutic community should feature a shared value system .\n",
            "Indeed , studies pursuing this thesis have been done in evaluating cross-cultural applications of counseling .\n",
            "For example , a particular analysis of Japanese-based psychotherapies analyzed differential approaches , concluding that goals are central to all approaches and that there is evidence of universal values in defining the fully functioning self .\n",
            "interpersonal values within each culture  .\n",
            "This approach has , in fact , resulted in some authors conceptualizing the psychotherapeutic process as \" healing by culture \"  .\n",
            "The exploration of societal values has been stressed as beneficial for discrete subpopulations .\n",
            "Some stress it as crucial for the therapeutic process in dealing specifically with adolescents  .\n",
            "Other foci seem to limit the salience of values only to specific contextual environments .\n",
            "As an example of the salience of values by treatment context , consider the conflict of the college based therapist , whose very work is embedded in an institution whose values have little relation to psychology .\n",
            "In such instances , it would be disruptive , both to the therapy process and to the client , to proceed without a keen awareness of the values of the host institution  .\n",
            "Detailed prerequisites are offered for the counselor entering the field , and research data are offered that a client who has knowledge about the counselor 's values and goals prior to psychotherapy is more able to make informed choices  .\n",
            "The non-sectarian Pastoral Counseling actually defines its uniqueness in the assumed similarity of values between therapist and client  .\n",
            "Moreover , some authors interpret the psychotherapeutic process in Pastoral Counseling as a moral enterprise  .\n",
            "Clearly , this approach need not be limited to the specific cultural , age-limited , or contextual therapies at all .\n",
            "It is posited that any therapeutic approach embodies its own unique value structure .\n",
            "The purpose of this investigation was to explore that value system of therapists adhering to a particular theoretical orientation .\n",
            "\" This eliminated our use of any of the instruments addressing \" mental health \" values , which may well be shared by those within the profession .\n",
            "One instrument which fits this criteria was the values survey developed by Rokeach  which has been most widely used to assess similar questions with a variety of populations .\n",
            "A search of Dissertation Abstracts Ondisc shows forty-nine citations for the instrument from  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  to  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , eighty citations from  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  to  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , forty-four citations from  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  to  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , and thirty citations from  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  through September of  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  .\n",

            "Rokeach  conceptualized human value systems as consisting of a relatively small number of core ideas or cognitions present in every society .\n",
            "This belief transcends attitudes toward objects and toward situations ; it is a standard that guides and determines action , attitudes toward objects and situations , ideology , presentations of self to others , evaluations , judgments , justifications , comparisons of self with others , and attempts to influence others  .\n",
            "In terms of context , Rokeach  suggested that values exist in hierarchies or priorities which involve the selection and organization of values into systems .\n",
            "In other words , values are not static and do not stand alone , but in relationship to each other .\n",
            "It is the system and the relationship of values to each other for a person at a particular time that are the most meaningful representations of the system .\n",
            "Simply put , these values are , in fact , goals .\n",

            "To add insult to injury , very few of these racks hold enough rods to satisfy today 's more advanced light-tackle anglers .\n",
            "And considering the rapidly growing popularity of fly fishing in both freshwater and saltwater , the number of rod racks that can not handle anything much over  NUM  feet in length never ceases to amaze me .\n",
            "The skiff I own today has super rod racks , primarily because over twenty years ago several of us were able to convince the owner of that small boat company that a good horizontal under-the-gunwale rod-holding system had many advantages .\n",
            "I 've also helped build up or modify quite a few other boats over the years - two of them for my own use - with do-it-yourself rod racks that really worked .\n",
            "As far as I 'm concerned , angled rodholders in the gunwales are fine for fishing applications such as trolling or live baiting , but poor for long runs at high speeds or trailering on the road .\n",
            "I once had a rod carelessly left in a gunwale angled holder disappear over the side of the boat during a relatively short but fast run in a moderately choppy sea ; I never missed the rod until I arrived at my next stop .\n",
            "On several occasions I 've seen rods bounce out of identical gunwale holders on trailered boats if the road happened to be a little bumpy .\n",
            "Even if recovered , the rods are usually damaged and the reels do n't work very well anymore .\n",
            "Horizontal rod racks are feasible on all but the very smallest of boats .\n",
            "But I can easily get eight casting/fly rods per side in my  NUM  NUM -foot skiff , and even a  NUM  NUM -footer two of us built up almost a decade ago could carry four to six rods per side .\n",
            "Assuming your boat already has sufficient gunwale overhang inside the cockpit to help protect the rods stowed thereunder , adding suitable racks is essentially a matter of installing two vertical supports per side .\n",
            "Extra-long rods like fly rods or casting sticks over  NUM - NUM / NUM  feet , however , will often require some additional support .\n",
            "If you do n't have inside gunwale overhang but would like to add that too , there 's a relatively easy way to do so .\n",

            "And , if you wish , you can easily flare the rear end of the PVC by dipping it in boiling water for a minute or so , then expanding it with anything large enough to get the job done - a soft drink bottle , for instance .\n",
            "Unless there 's so much curvature in the hull that the tubing can not be made to conform by hand , you won't have to heat it to bend it .\n",

            "Hold the tubing there until it cools sufficiently to retain the desired shape .\n",
            "Obviously , it is prudent to wear thick gloves or use potholders while engaged in this maneuver .\n",

            "Top support , along with a flexible adhesive  used to anchor the supports to the side of the boat , is the method I 've obtained the most satisfactory results with .\n",
            "If you do n't want to drill down through the gunwales to attach the supports , you can use sturdy aluminum angle stock to do the same from the underside .\n",
            "Both methods have worked well for me .\n",
            "If you find it desirable to add gunwale overhang inside the boat , you might want to use the rod racks as vertical supports .\n",
            "This usually is n't necessary , however , so whether or not the racks themselves actually touch the cockpit floor is n't important .\n",
            "On some of the smaller round-chine aluminum skiffs I 've modified , it was n't even practical .\n",
