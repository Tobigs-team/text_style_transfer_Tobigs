            "At that time , all these sentiments were also true of my unquestioned attitudes toward my father .\n",
            "Writing my own article for the EB was a psychological landmark ; it gave me a voice of my own .\n",
            "I suddenly felt like Ernest Pontifex , in The Way of All Flesh , who was finally able to contravene his father without feeling that he was either destroying or betraying him .\n",
            "Before I wrote my  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  article , I looked at two or three earlier pieces .\n",
            "It did not occur to me then to view them as documents of intellectual history ; I merely wished to identify my predecessors ' pitfalls - such as an overreliance on dreary tables of statistics - so I could avoid stepping into them myself .\n",
            "I wrote the article and proudly added the Fourteenth Edition of the Britannica to the Ninth Edition that still reposed in the glass-fronted Stickley bookcase that I had inherited .\n",
            "Two and a half decades passed .\n",
            "Then , as I approached the age of eighty , I had another thought .\n",
            "Why not examine the articles on suicide in all the editions since the first one , in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  ?\n",
            "The idea allowed me simultaneously to become , all over again , the unformed child in a soft bed who had learned about the world from his parents ' encyclopedia , and also to read these articles on suicide - including my own - and see , from the emancipated vantage point of old age , their flaws , their anachronisms , their generational gaps of knowledge .\n",
            "If the Britannica was the most authoritative popular repository of knowledge during the various eras of its existence , would not its successive treatments of suicide reflect , in a long chronological march , our culture 's changing attitudes toward the subject that had consumed my life ?\n",

            "With the Fifteenth Edition , in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , there was a radical restructuring of the overall format of the EB : the timehonored , strictly alphabetical arrangement was dropped in favor of a thesaurus-like approach , including a one-volume Propaedia  , a Micropaedia  , and a Macropaedia  .\n",

            "The anonymous author of this mean-spirited little article - whose only mention of prevention is its approving note on the custom , prevalent at the time , of besmirching the self-murderer 's reputation and confiscating his worldly goods - is clearly far more interested in flagellating the suicide than in keeping him alive .\n",

            "The tone of this report can be gathered from the paragraph on suicide among the Jews :  Suicide is one of those crimes which we are led to believe not common among savage nations .\n",
            "The first instances of it recorded in the Jewish history are those of Saul and Ahitophel ; for we do not think the death of Samson a proper example .\n",
            "We have no reason to suppose it became common among the Jews till their wars with the Romans , when multitudes slaughtered themselves that they might not fall alive into the hands of their enemies .\n",
            "But at this period the Jews were a most desperate and abandoned race of men , had corrupted the religion of their fathers , and rejected that pure system which their promised Messiah came to Jerusalem to announce .\n",
            "As for the causes of suicide in England , they are ascribed to \" the variableness of the climate , the great use of animal food , strong spiritous liquors and to tea , and to the sulphurous exhalations of the pit-coal used as fuel .\n",
            "We are rather surprised that coal is mentioned even as a distant cause of suicide , for it is one of the blessings of our island ; and a good coal fire we have always found rather conducive to good spirits rather than injurious to them .\n",
            "\" It is rare to find such a cozy passage in the staid pages of the EB .\n",
            "Having disposed of history and causation , the article moves on to the aspects that had constituted the entirety of the  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  article : the morality and legality of suicide .\n",
            "It reasserts that suicide is a felo-de-se  , a crime against God and the king .\n",
            "Punishment will not be a preventive , even if it could be always inflicted ; and that it is seldom inflicted , though the laws have decreed it , is well known .\n",
            "\" This Concluding emphasis on prevention , complete with a humble acknowledgment of its difficulty , sounds surprisingly modern .\n",
            "The historical portions of this entry appeared essentially unchanged for sixty-four years in the Fourth  , Fifth  , Sixth  , and Seventh  Editions .\n",
            "But changes were coming .\n",
            "The entry for \" Suicide \" in the Eighth Edition  in many ways repeats the contents of the Seventh .\n",
            "However , it is notable for including landmark quotations from two major nineteenth-century intellectual figures .\n",
            "The first quotation is from Henry Thomas Buckle , chess prodigy and scientifically minded historian .\n",
            "Buckle believes that \" the progress of every people is regulated by principles .\n",
            "He states that  suicide is merely the product of the general condition of society , and that the individual only carries into effect what is a necessary consequence of preceding circumstance .\n",
            "thus we are able to predict within a small limit of error the number of voluntary deaths for each ensuing period , assuming , of course , that the social circumstances do not undergo marked change .\n",
            "Buckle 's morally neutral stance , which transfers blame from the individual to his society , neatly moves suicide from the purview of religion to that of social science and presages the key role that demography was soon to play in its study .\n",
            "The second quotation is from the great philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill .\n",
            "In his essay \" On Liberty \" - in which he opposed any legislation that would interfere with the sale of poisons on the ground that it would exert unnecessary state control over individual freedom-he wrote  , he ought , I conceive , be only warned of the danger , not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it .\n",
            "This prescient paragraph contains the core arguments of current controversies and debates : Do people own their own lives  , or are we as a society responsible for saving our fellows from their own errors ?\n",
            "Mill 's libertarian voice was destined to be outshouted by the subsequent inundation of articles that concentrated on numbers rather than ethics .\n",
            "The Ninth Edition  contains a six-page article by Wynnard Hooper , a financial journalist who , tellingly , also wrote the pieces on statistics and population .\n",
            "Hooper includes five tables of European suicide statistics and one table for certain American states , and discusses these figures in terms of race , sex , climate , population density , occupations , seasons , and methods of suicide .\n",
            "He concludes that \" it can not be said that any satisfactory result has been obtained from these investigations , owing no doubt to the fact that the phenomenon is too minute to furnish numbers large enough for the proper application of the statistical method .\n",
            "\" His article marks a radical swing to the demographic and statistical approach , reflecting and foreshadowing the work of Morselli , Durkheim , Halbwachs , and Dublin .\n",
            "It cut the pattern for the next hundred years .\n",
            "The Tenth Edition  contains an unmemorable two-page article , essentially a shortened version of the article in the previous edition , by H. H. Littlejohn , a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Edinburgh .\n",
            "Like Buckle and Hooper , Littlejohn regards suicide as \" a sign of the presence of maladies in the body politic which deserve careful consideration .\n",
            "\" He asserts that \" suicide as a whole conforms to certain general laws , and is influenced by conditions other than mere individual circumstances or surroundings .\n",
            "\" His article , mainly concerned with British suicide statistics for the  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM s and  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM s , was repeated in the Twelfth  and Thirteenth  Editions .\n",
            "The article on suicide in the Fourteenth Edition  went through numerous versions in different printings .\n",
            "In every case the war period is marked by a notable decline in the suicide-rate .\n",
            "To the theory that nervous strain is one of the prime causes which lead to self-destruction , they give a complete and emphatic contradiction .\n",
            "The  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM - NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  printings of the Fourteenth Edition contained a short piece by Ruth S. Cavan , an American sociologist , which was perhaps the most succinct and most comprehensive to date .\n",
            "Within the compass of a single page , it includes pithy paragraphs on a variety of subtopics : international comparisons ; age , sex , and marital conditions ; urban-rural rates ; methods of suicide ; suicide and other means of violent death ; and interpretations .\n",
            "Cavan concludes :  Although suicide rates differ with various social conditions , the explanation does not lie in external forces but in the attitudes and emotions of people .\n",
            "Some people are subjected to greater social pressures than others .\n",
            "This brief bit of wisdom touches both the inner and the outer worlds of suicide with more empathy than any of Cavan 's predecessors had shown .\n",
            "My turn came in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , in an article that deliberately owed little to its forerunners .\n",
            "Its seven pages contained not a single statistical table .\n",
            "The sections included : definition , complexities of definitions , major threads of study , psychological characteristics of suicide , attempted suicide , partial death and substitutes for suicide , suicide and religion , suicide and the law , myths about suicide , romantic suicide and the artist , statistics on suicide , suicide notes , and * NUM  NUM ; NUM  NUM  NUM ;TOOLONG .\n",
            "One example will suffice to convey the article 's general tenor .\n",
            "Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas called suicide a grievous sin and located its source within the deficient person ; Rousseau emphasized the natural and innocent state of man and transferred the locus of blame from man to society ; Hume tried to sanitize suicide entirely by arguing that it was neither a crime nor a sin ; Durkheim focused on society 's inimical effects on the individual ; and Freud , eschewing the notions of sin and crime , gave suicide back to the individual but put the main locus of action in the unconscious mind .\n",
            "In other words , I attempted to present a variety of views on suicide instead of the single opinions that had dominated most of the earlier articles .\n",
            "Here is the heart of what - now that I have read all the earlier articles - I feel the EB had previously omitted : a recognition of suicide as a response to individual human suffering , a tragedy that befalls real people .\n",
            "This article had a noteworthy personal consequence .\n",
            "For many years - from  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , when I met him , until his death in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  at the age of ninety-five - the psychological epicenter of my intellectual life was Henry A. Murray : physician , psychoanalyst , biologist , Melville scholar , director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic , and author of Explorations in Personality .\n",
            "Murray 's peerless writings influenced me more than any others , and I tried to spend as much time as possible in his presence .\n",
            "It was one of life 's high privileges for me to know him and to be made , by him , much more than I otherwise could have been .\n",
            "In  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , in a paper about Melville titled \" Dead to the World , \" Murray had defined suicide as \" no more than an urgently felt necessity to stop unbearable anguish , that is , to obtain relief by interrupting the stream of suffering .\n",
            "\" He asked : \" For what is suicide in most instances but an action to put an end to intolerable affect ?\n",
            "\" You can see right away that my main ideas about the central role in suicide of psychological pain and negative emotions all flow from his fountain .\n",
            "In any event , in February  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , Harry wrote me :  Your encyclopaedia article is masterful .\n",
            "handsomely written to a marked extent in your own terminology .\n",
            "I knew Harry well enough to put aside his hyperbolic praise and to know that the real meat of that paragraph - his covertly intended message - lay in the serious criticism implied in the second sentence .\n",
            "He was telling me what I already knew inside : that I was temporarily burned out on the topic of suicide and ought to consider a shift of focus for a while .\n",
            "Harry 's note resonated with my own suspicion , which I had not fully admitted to myself until I read his words , that my EB article had been a mite too discursive and idiosyncratic .\n",
            "Accordingly , I shifted my clinical focus from patients who were suicidal to cancer patients who were coming to death unwillingly .\n",
            "I transformed myself from clinical suicidologist to clinical thanatologist , someone who deals with illness and mourning .\n",
            "When I returned to suicide a few years later , I believe I did so with a refreshed vision of self-destruction as well as a better understanding of the dynamics involved in the wrestling match with death .\n",
            "Its most innovative section is headed \" Suicide in the Future , \" and Stengel 's predictions are not particularly rosy .\n",
            "He writes :  It is difficult to imagine man in the future without this potential , which has sometimes been proclaimed as one of the basic human freedoms .\n",
            "There are no prospects of an antisuicidal substance in the foreseeable future .\n",
            "There are certain aspects of present-day society that make a decline in the incidence of suicidal acts unlikely including the increased number of the aged .\n",
            "the young who are more openly aggressive .\n",
            "the continued increase in population .\n",
            "The outlook for suicide would be very black indeed if it were not for the strong urge to self-preservation inherent in the individual and in society .\n",
            "This is manifestly an encyclopedia article and not a novel .\n",
            "But Stengel 's empathetic sadness , deepened by his own background as a refugee from the Nazis , clearly shows through his prose and , in my view , makes it finer .\n",
            "Inexplicably , there are printings of the Fifteenth Edition in which Stengel 's indispensable essay on suicide does not appear .\n",
            "In these cases , I strongly advise the reader to seek another printing .\n",
            "In the  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM - NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  printings of the Fifteenth Edition there is a half-page article in the Micropaedia  .\n",
            "Its concluding paragraph is especially topical :  No single approach can be expected to succeed in substantially reducing the incidence of suicide , but early detection and treatment of mental disorders are important deterrents .\n",
            "Since the  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM s special centres and organizations for the prevention of suicide have been created in many countries .\n",
            "There is evidence that this kind of service may help to avert suicidal acts .\n",
            "The Encyclopaedia Britannica - along with our society - has obviously traveled several light-years since  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  , when it excoriated suicide as cowardly , sinful , illegal , and shameful .\n",
            "The emphasis has shifted to the question , \" How can we help ?\n",
            "\"  My march through the centuries is complete , but a few ideas still swirl in the wake of my dual obsessions , suicide and the EB .\n",
            "The first idea is that there might be something to learn from similar Britannica surveys of other socially sensitive tag words .\n",
            "One might look , from  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM   to the present date , at Addiction , Adultery , Childhood , Homosexuality , Insanity , and so forth .\n",

            "Why not take a look at the word in dictionaries of the past couple of hundred years ?\n",
            "Authoritative definitions are important .\n",
            "Indeed , dictionaries might provide us with a microcosm of what was happening in the encyclopedias of their times .\n",
            "I believe I have good reason , beyond the fact that it is my own field , to think that our society 's views of suicide are important to all of us .\n",
            "I learned from a study I once did with the coroner of Marin County , California , that more than a quarter of all deaths - all deaths , not just overt suicides - are probably interlaced with threads of imprudence , disregard , excess , indifference , or ennui that bring an end to life sooner than is necessary .\n",
            "In other words , some people who have died what I call \" subintentioned deaths \" from heart attacks or automobile accidents may have a good deal in common with people who are termed \" suicides .\n",
            "The definition of any important term such as suicide gives it power-and also gives it honorific , neutral , or pejorative overtones .\n",
            "Denotation influences connotation .\n",
            "The connotative meanings of a word govern society 's responses to it .\n",
            "These community responses can cover a wide range : in the case of suicide , one extreme includes scorn , indifference , and punishment , and the other extreme includes empathy and therapy .\n",
            "And even within the realm of therapy , the very modalities are influenced by definition .\n",
            "Whether the therapeutic response is primarily pharmacological  , surgical  , electrical  , institutional  , or psychodynamic  - differences that are not trivial-may depend on the inner , unspoken definition of suicide and its connotative associations that one 's physician happens to hold .\n",

            "Nonetheless , the belief in a large southern land region led Ptolemy in the second century C.E. to posit the \" Terra Australis Incognita , \" a southern continent completely enclosing the Indian Ocean - an hypothesis that would be accepted as geographical fad for the next fifteen hundred years .\n",

            "Because of their focus on reason , Humanists are often mistakenly thought of as unemotional .\n",
            "But emotions are an important aspect of learning .\n",
            "When your child is happy about learning something at school , be sure to reinforce that feeling .\n",
            "When your child tells you about a school experience , ask for details and express your feelings .\n",
            "For example , in discussing a book read in class , ask how the protagonists must have felt in the situation your child describes .\n",
            "Share your own feelings with your child or memories of similar experiences in your life .\n",

            "Do n't be too quick with the easy answer , too quick to be an expert .\n",
            "Good teachers are worth their weight in gold ; experts are a dime a dozen .\n",
            "Problem solving is a learnable set of steps using logic , rationalism , organizational skills , and decision-making patterns .\n",
            "Help your child think through these processes .\n",
            "While we should n't deliberately withhold information , a measured response can help a child to think critically and develop an answer on his or her own .\n",
            "* Children gain self-esteem by learning and sharing knowledge .\n",
            "Being able to contribute as part of a team rather than as a mere recipient of information builds a child 's sense of self-worth .\n",
            "* Many become excessively dependent on a psychoanalyst , a cleric , a political leader , a parent , or a physician to provide them with their beliefs .\n",
            "Fundamentalism is n't limited the fringes of some religions .\n",
            "The importance of an authority figure to many people is growing , not diminishing as we might hope as time goes on and society matures .\n",
            "We all need to be careful to avoid creating powerful dependency needs in our children .\n",
            "Ask yourself if it 's more important that your children be just like you or that they each be independent , self-reliant individuals , even if it means you might disagree on some issues .\n",
            "The most functional parents guide their children to independence .\n",
            "Be a guide on the side , not a sage on a stage .\n",
            "* As a parent , you can help your children enormously to become self-learners by supporting their skills in making choices .\n",
            "Learning the processes of making choices - weighing the alternatives , remembering earlier experiences , seeing what others have done in similar situations - can be of enormous help to them , especially as they face issues like the temptations of drug use , choice of friends , career goals , and the like .\n",
            "How your children make these choices is a learning to learn issue and one that most of us neglect in our own lives .\n",

            "In the lower center of the screen is a single block which may be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise by touching the adjacent curved arrows .\n",
            "Touching the small white block at the bottom of the screen makes the larger block white , touching the black one changes it to black , and touching the small white and black block has the effect of changing the pattern of the larger block to black and white .\n",
            "Errors may be corrected by choosing another block and copying it into the same section of the duplicate design .\n",
            "Procedure  Subjects were seated in front of the computer , and instructed in the use of the touch screen to choose and rotate the block on the screen .\n",
            "Subjects then practiced manipulating the block .\n",
            "They were next shown a nine-block practice design .\n",
            "The experimenter demonstrated the use of the touch screen to copy the design , cleared the response area , and allowed subjects to practice building the design .\n",
            "When they finished the practice design , the testing session began .\n",
            "Each testing session consisted of  NUM  NUM  designs of varying difficulty which were presented in random order .\n",
            "Subjects had unlimited time to complete each design ; they indicated they had completed a design by touching the button on the screen labeled \" finished .\n",
            "After the subject left the laboratory ?\n",
            "the data were printed and stored on disk .\n",
            "RESULTS  The measures of performance used in this study were response time , manipulations , moves , and correct completions .\n",
            "Response time represents the mean number of seconds that elapsed from the time a stimulus pattern was first displayed until subjects touched the \" finished \" button .\n",
            "The term manipulations refers to the number of screen touches per trial outside the constructed design ; moves are screen touches per trial within the constructed design .\n",
            "Correct completions are the number of designs accurately reproduced per subject .\n",
            "Descriptive data for each are displayed in Table  NUM  .\n",
            "Coeffecient alpha was calculated as an estimate of internal consistency for each measure ; the results are also displayed in Table  NUM  .\n",
            "The correlation matrix in Table  NUM  portrays the relationship of the variables to one another .\n",
            "DISCUSSION  Measures of block design performance , except correct completions , show moderate to good reliability .\n",
            "Since nine moves are required to complete each design , the mean of  NUM  NUM .\n",
            "NUM  NUM  indicates that subjects on average made fewer than three errors of placement per design .\n",
            "The correct completion rate of  NUM  NUM .\n",
            "NUM percent also represents a substantial ceiling effect .\n",
            "This suggests that reliability of the nontemporal measures could be increased if the difficulty of the task was raised to the point at which subjects made more errors when building designs , and failed to accurately reproduce some designs .\n",
            "Increased reliability might conceivably be achieved by increasing the number of blocks per design , increasing the complexity of stimulus patterns , or requiring subjects to construct a rotation or mirror image of the stimulus design .\n",
            "One may also assume a sample of college undergraduates represents a notable restriction of range by comparison to the standardization sample of a test such as the WAIS-R ; testing a more diverse sample would undoubtedly bolster the reliability of the weaker measures .\n",
            "In addition , the consistency and ease of administration inherent in computerized tests suggest that this task may have utility for the general population as well .\n",
            "Our purpose in this study is to view theories of psychotherapy from a general social-political context , especially insofar as they pertain to values .\n",
            "Beginning with Weisskopf-Joelson 's  thesis that theories of psychotherapy may be \" perceptual houses \" with their own unique value structures , we studied the values of psychoanalytic psychotherapists within the framework of Rokeach 's  system .\n",

            "Because neither group of subjects can be regarded as randomly representative of the universe of psychoanalysts , we regard the resultant data as evocative and informative rather than definitive .\n",
            "Nonetheless , we examined the extent to which value profiles for the psychoanalytic trainees of  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  were similar or dissimilar to those of practicing psychoanalysts in  NUM  NUM  NUM  NUM  .\n",
            "Such comparisons at the least provide some general indication as to whether valu es have shifted in the universe within this time period .\n",

            "In addition , values have generated interest in such areas as \" moral \" and \" value \" education and \" values clarification .\n",
            "\" This pervasiveness attests to the importance of the notion as well as to its lack of clarity .\n",
            "People have values .\n",
            "Institutions have values .\n",
            "Societies have values .\n",
            "These seem to be accepted truths , although they remain vague and general .\n",
            "Not surprisingly , the field of psychotherapy has not been immune from the wide ranging , yet imprecise , presence of the elusive construct of values .\n",
            "The values that an individual can express are very much constrained by the character of the social institutions and the social order in which that individual lives  .\n",
            "Rokeach  , in addressing this issue , defined institutional values as \" socially shared cognitive representations of institutional goals and demands \"  and suggested that \" the most distinctive property or defining characteristic of a social institution is its values \"  .\n",
            "Scientific psychology has consistently kept the question of values out of its system , in its attempt to stress the scientifically objective component of its field  .\n",
            "In this context , it is interesting to find that some authors see psychotherapy as sharing the interactional arena with the arts , in that they both feature the constant interchange between values and technique  even though it was understood that people could not maintain this ideal objective stance .\n",
            "It would appear that , although values were recognized as inevitable , the ideal remained of a possible value-free endeavor , and deviation there-from were seen as problems of the therapist or labeled as \" countertransference .\n",
            "\" Indeed , values have often been noted in psychotherapy in a negative context - i.e. , as a problem when therapy is not proceeding according to the \" script .\n",
            "In a circumscribed context , however , values were reckoned with in a positive perspective .\n",
            "Hartman  conceptualized one prevalent view by positing that the only values that are relevant in psychotherapy are so called \" health values , \" or those very directly related to the work at hand .\n",
            "These \" health values \" have generated definitions ranging from Freud 's  truth and reality , to the sufficient conditions for the nurturing of the ego  , the facilitating environment of Object Relations theory  , the definition of the self  , awareness and integration in a Gestalt perspective  , and Rogers '  basic therapeutic conditions , to present a representative sample .\n",
            "Instead , they are often featured in fields which represent the intersections of psychotherapy and allied disciplines .\n",
            "The contemporary psychosomatic approach incorporates values into its presuppositions  .\n",
            "The hermeneutic method of analyzing psychotherapy , for example , refers to \" guiding values \" of the conversation which effects change  .\n",
            "The adherents of Logotherapy blatantly present their approach as a system of values similar to those of a secular religion  .\n",
            "Related to the latter characterization , is the assumption in existential psychology that one 's attitude toward authenticity is influenced by the therapist 's personal values  .\n",
            "Moreover , values are intrinsic to some of the more recent areas where psychology and social issues have been synthesized .\n",
            "Constructivism , for example , sees values as playing a central role in clinical practice  .\n",
            "Other authors actually typify feminist-oriented psychotherapy by positing a distinct value profile for the approach  .\n",
            "Postmodern authors on psychotherapy uniformly highlight the salience of the practitioner 's values  .\n",
            "An index of values ' emerging prominence in the field is the recent straightforward call by the Society for the Exploration of Psychotherapy Integration , calling for the definition of psychotherapy integration while highlighting values as a cardinal factor in therapy  .\n",
            "It is noteworthy that the directionality of influence between psychotherapy and values also runs in the reverse .\n",
            "Thus , criteria have been offered for therapists to determine whether their clients ' religiosity is particularly healthy or unhealthy  , which seems to portend an attempt at objectively qualifying the legitimacy  of values in the counseling interaction .\n",
            "In categorizing values by the phenomena which precipitate and give rise to the values , some authors have been led to actually categorize values as rational vs.\n",
            "Specifically , individual values will often entail goals which encroach on others ' needs , while societal values often usurp individual needs for the good of the larger group .\n",
            "The therapies can be seen as attempting to balance intrinsic values against the backdrop of a field-wide mor of commitment to human freedom without dogmatism , in a mode which will respect human autonomy .\n",
            "In a detailed analysis of therapy approaches , Richardson  shows how Freud , Jung , Fromm , and Rational Emotive approaches all employ similar strategies in dealing with this freedom-commitment dilemma , although each stresses different aspects as primary .\n",
            "Weiskopf-Joelson refers to each school of psychotherapy as a \" perceptual house \" since each perspective brings with it a distinct set of preconceptions and apperceptions which structure reality according to its a priori postulates and beliefs .\n",
            "These \" houses \" include value systems which , though rarely explicit , are nonetheless normative in that setting and are seen as desirable goals of any therapeutic intervention .\n",
            "If they are \" perceptual houses , \" then they are not merely a collection of individuals but have more the qualities and characteristics of an institution .\n",
            "It follows , then , that as a prototype of an institution , each therapeutic community should feature a shared value system .\n",
            "Indeed , studies pursuing this thesis have been done in evaluating cross-cultural applications of counseling .\n",
            "For example , a particular analysis of Japanese-based psychotherapies analyzed differential approaches , concluding that goals are central to all approaches and that there is evidence of universal values in defining the fully functioning self .\n",
            "interpersonal values within each culture  .\n",
            "This approach has , in fact , resulted in some authors conceptualizing the psychotherapeutic process as \" healing by culture \"  .\n",
            "The exploration of societal values has been stressed as beneficial for discrete subpopulations .\n",
            "Some stress it as crucial for the therapeutic process in dealing specifically with adolescents  .\n",
            "Other foci seem to limit the salience of values only to specific contextual environments .\n",
            "As an example of the salience of values by treatment context , consider the conflict of the college based therapist , whose very work is embedded in an institution whose values have little relation to psychology .\n",
            "In such instances , it would be disruptive , both to the therapy process and to the client , to proceed without a keen awareness of the values of the host institution  .\n",
            "Detailed prerequisites are offered for the counselor entering the field , and research data are offered that a client who has knowledge about the counselor 's values and goals prior to psychotherapy is more able to make informed choices  .\n",
            "The non-sectarian Pastoral Counseling actually defines its uniqueness in the assumed similarity of values between therapist and client  .\n",
            "Moreover , some authors interpret the psychotherapeutic process in Pastoral Counseling as a moral enterprise  .\n",
            "Clearly , this approach need not be limited to the specific cultural , age-limited , or contextual therapies at all .\n",
            "It is posited that any therapeutic approach embodies its own unique value structure .\n",
            "The purpose of this investigation was to explore that value system of therapists adhering to a particular theoretical orientation .\n",
            "\" This eliminated our use of any of the instruments addressing \" mental health \" values , which may well be shared by those within the profession .\n",

            "In terms of context , Rokeach  suggested that values exist in hierarchies or priorities which involve the selection and organization of values into systems .\n",

            "Some are so bad they are more likely to ensure rod damage than promote rod safety .\n",
            "To add insult to injury , very few of these racks hold enough rods to satisfy today 's more advanced light-tackle anglers .\n",
            "And considering the rapidly growing popularity of fly fishing in both freshwater and saltwater , the number of rod racks that can not handle anything much over  NUM  feet in length never ceases to amaze me .\n",
            "The skiff I own today has super rod racks , primarily because over twenty years ago several of us were able to convince the owner of that small boat company that a good horizontal under-the-gunwale rod-holding system had many advantages .\n",
            "I 've also helped build up or modify quite a few other boats over the years - two of them for my own use - with do-it-yourself rod racks that really worked .\n",
            "As far as I 'm concerned , angled rodholders in the gunwales are fine for fishing applications such as trolling or live baiting , but poor for long runs at high speeds or trailering on the road .\n",
            "I once had a rod carelessly left in a gunwale angled holder disappear over the side of the boat during a relatively short but fast run in a moderately choppy sea ; I never missed the rod until I arrived at my next stop .\n",
            "On several occasions I 've seen rods bounce out of identical gunwale holders on trailered boats if the road happened to be a little bumpy .\n",
            "Even if recovered , the rods are usually damaged and the reels do n't work very well anymore .\n",
            "Horizontal rod racks are feasible on all but the very smallest of boats .\n",
            "But I can easily get eight casting/fly rods per side in my  NUM  NUM -foot skiff , and even a  NUM  NUM -footer two of us built up almost a decade ago could carry four to six rods per side .\n",
            "Assuming your boat already has sufficient gunwale overhang inside the cockpit to help protect the rods stowed thereunder , adding suitable racks is essentially a matter of installing two vertical supports per side .\n",
            "Extra-long rods like fly rods or casting sticks over  NUM - NUM / NUM  feet , however , will often require some additional support .\n",
            "If you do n't have inside gunwale overhang but would like to add that too , there 's a relatively easy way to do so .\n",
            "The rod racks can be made of wood , which is n't expensive , and you can easily cut it yourself .\n",
            "The easiest way to get the right fit for under-gunwale rod supports is to first make templates out of cardboard .\n",
            "The supports should be no more than  NUM  NUM  inches apart ; otherwise short rods will flex up and down severely when the going gets bumpy .\n",
            "There must also be enough space between the aft support and the transom or any other bulkhead for the rod handles .\n",
            "All rods except fly rods are best supported immediately below the reels .\n",
            "As for the tips , if there is excessive curvature where the longer rods makes contact with the hull , you might want to add the protection of PVC tubing .\n",
            "The heavy walled variety is n't needed , and in fact is more difficult to work with , so use the lightest you can buy .\n",

            "At the talks , Iran agreed in principle to export most of its enriched uranium for processing , a step that would have bought more time for negotiations by reducing the amount of potential bomb-making material in Iran 's hands for up to a year .\n",

            "For Mr. Barak , that is evidence that the \" zone of immunity \" he has warned about - the point at which Iran will be able to produce nuclear fuel from a site invulnerable to attack - will be reached in a matter of weeks .\n",
            "Only a third of the centrifuges at Fordow are actually operating , the inspectors reported , leaving open the question of whether Iran has run into technical difficulties or has made a political decision not to tempt its adversaries by rushing ahead in moving production of fuel to its best-protected facility .\n",
            "And while the agency 's statistics show that Iran has , since February , doubled its stockpile of fuel enriched to  NUM  NUM  percent purity - a level that bomb experts say could be converted to bomb grade in a matter of months - it still does not possess enough of that fuel to produce a complete nuclear weapon .\n",
